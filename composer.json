	"description": "The module extends the built-in `DatetimeField` form field with `TZDateTimeField`,
		which allows selection of date and time, with a timezone dropdown.
		This enables an automatic conversion between a user selected timezone
		and the server timezone when saving the field, but it also allows
		converting the date on the fly by changing to a different timezone.
		Internally, the date and time are always saved in the server timezone,
		so this is a purely presentational setting.",
